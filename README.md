# SharpStudy Frontend Application

This repository is for the SharpStudy web app.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

- Clone this repo
- `cd` into the source dir

### Prerequisites

Grab a copy of the `.env` file from any of the developers working on the project. It should have a structure like below:

```
LOGIN_URL_ENDPOINT="............"
SIGN_IN_URL_ENDPOINT="..........."
```

[Install yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) globally on your machine

```
curl -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

### Installing

With the `.env` file at the root directory of your system, and with yarn installed:

- Install dependencies using `yarn`

```
yarn
```

- Once the dependencies are installed, then ensure that you have the right API link uncommented out in the env file. Look out for `LOGIN_URL_ENDPOINT="............"` and `SIGN_IN_URL_ENDPOINT="...........`, and use `"backend local URL"` when you have backend server running locally. Once ready, then start the frontend server

```
yarn start
```

You can view this app running app on http://localhost:3000
